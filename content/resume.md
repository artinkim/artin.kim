## Notable Projects

### Headlights [Firmware](https://github.com/AdinAck/Headlights-Firmware) | [Hardware](https://github.com/AdinAck/Headlights-Hardware) | [App](https://github.com/AdinAck/Headlights-App)

_May 2023 - December 2023_

Designed a 100v current-mode digital SMPS from scratch for driving high-voltage headlights.

**Hardware** - half-bridge bootstrapping, slew rate tuning, dead-time insertion, layout optimization, high voltage/current considerations, "crumple zones".

**Firmware** - maximal constant evaluation, (de)serialization, procedurally defined multi-target command pattern with idempotence, safety critical guarentees by proof, high-precision feedback, hardware driven concurrency, time-sensitive routines, persistent configuration, multi-redundancy, monomorphized dynamic dispatch.

### LEGv8 Simulator [Source](https://github.com/AdinAck/LEGv8-Simulator)

_September 2022_

Created a comprehensive LEGv8 assembly simulation and analysis software for educational purposes.

**Features** - stack and frame pointer tracking across memory, "inspector" for comparing blame and value across time, breakpoints, line-by-line execution, verbose errors.

### FOC Motor Controller [Source](https://github.com/AdinAck/Motor-Controller)

_June 2021 - July 2021_

Developed a high density FOC motor controller for use with [SimpleFOC](https://simplefoc.com) project. My board became a popular community choice.
